## Summary 
Our agent in this submission is a prototype of our final agent. The agent should survive in the world as long as possible by learning to avoid enemies’ attacks. If attacked, the agent’s health points will be deducted and it will die and quit immediately when its health points reaches 0. Our goal is make our agent survive in a random world longer by integrating q learning algorithm in its learning part.
