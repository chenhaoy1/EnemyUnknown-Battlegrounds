## Project Summary
We plan to develop and implement an AI, which can survive as long as possible in its world, while its world has different enemies, such as zombies, ghosts and fireballs. The main objective would be the agent could survive with the longest time. In order to reach this objective, the agent may find any materials in its world and produce weapons to kill the enemies and defend itself.

The input should be the agent's nearby environment, which would be represented as a grid map. The output should be a tuple of state and actions,which includes the agent's current state and one or more actions for agent to implement.
