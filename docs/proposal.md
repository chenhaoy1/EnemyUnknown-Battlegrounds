## Project Summary
We plan to develop and implement an AI, which can survive as long as possible in its world, while its world has different enemies, such as cave spiders, Magma Cube and Vindicators. The main objective would focus on eliminating more monsters with less damage on its health. In order to reach this objective, the agent may find any materials in its world and produce weapons to kill the enemies and defend itself. Besides, in order to maintain its life, the agent may hunt for preys to gain meat and recover a certain health points.

The input should be the agent's nearby environment, which would be represented as a grid map. The output should be a tuple of state and actions,which includes the agent's current state and one or more actions for agent to implement.
